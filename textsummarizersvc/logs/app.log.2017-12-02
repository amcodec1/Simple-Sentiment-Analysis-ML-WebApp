2017-12-02 14:09:30,468 - {'content_title': "Google's AI Wins Pivotal Second Game in Match With Go Grandmaster", 'content_text': 'After more than four hours of tight play and a rapid-fire endgame, Google\'s artificially intelligent Go-playing computer system has won a second contest against grandmaster Lee Sedol, taking a two-games-to-none lead in their historic best-of-five match in downtown Seoul.  The surprisingly skillful Google machine, known as AlphaGo, now needs only one more win to claim victory in the match. The Korean-born Lee Sedol will go down in defeat unless he takes each of the match\'s last three games. Though machines have beaten the best humans at chess, checkers, Othello, Scrabble, Jeopardy!, and so many other games considered tests of human intellect, they have never beaten the very best at Go. Game Three is set for Saturday afternoon inside Seoul\'s Four Seasons hotel.  The match is a way of judging the suddenly rapid progress of artificial intelligence. One of the machine-learning techniques at the heart of AlphaGo has already reinvented myriad online services inside Google and other big-name Internet companies, helping to identify images, recognize commands spoken into smartphones, improve search engine results, and more. Meanwhile, another AlphaGo technique is now driving experimental robotics at Google and places like the University of California at Berkeley. This week\'s match can show how far these technologies have come - and perhaps how far they will go.  Created in Asia over 2,500 year ago, Go is exponentially more complex than chess, and at least among humans, it requires an added degree of intuition. Lee Sedol is widely-regarded as the top Go player of the last decade, after winning more international titles than all but one other player. He is currently ranked number five in the world, and according to Demis Hassabis, who leads DeepMind, the Google AI lab that created AlphaGo, his team chose the Korean for this all-important match because they wanted an opponent who would be remembered as one of history\'s great players.  Although AlphaGo topped Lee Sedol in the match\'s first game on Wednesday afternoon, the outcome of Game Two was no easier to predict. In his 1996 match with IBM\'s Deep Blue supercomputer, world chess champion Gary Kasparov lost the first game but then came back to win the second game and, eventually, the match as a whole. It wasn\'t until the following year that Deep Blue topped Kasparov over the course of a six-game contest. The thing to realize is that, after playing AlphaGo for the first time on Wednesday, Lee Sedol could adjust his style of play - just as Kasparov did back in 1996. But AlphaGo could not. Because this Google creation relies so heavily on machine learning techniques, the DeepMind team needs a good four to six weeks to train a new incarnation of the system. And that means they can\'t really change things during this eight-day match.  "This is about teaching and learning," Hassabis told us just before Game Two. "One game is not enough data to learn from - for a machine - and training takes an awful lot of time.'}

One of the machine-learning techniques at the heart of AlphaGo has already reinvented myriad online services inside Google and other big-name Internet companies, helping to identify images, recognize commands spoken into smartphones, improve search engine results, and more. Meanwhile, another AlphaGo technique is now driving experimental robotics at Google and places like the University of California at Berkeley. This week\'s match can show how far these technologies have come - and perhaps how far they will go.  Created in Asia over 2,500 year ago, Go is exponentially more complex than chess, and at least among humans, it requires an added degree of intuition. Lee Sedol is widely-regarded as the top Go player of the last decade, after winning more international titles than all but one other player. He is currently ranked number five in the world, and according to Demis Hassabis, who leads DeepMind, the Google AI lab that created AlphaGo, his team chose the Korean for this all-important match because they wanted an opponent who would be remembered as one of history\'s great players.  Although AlphaGo topped Lee Sedol in the match\'s first game on Wednesday afternoon, the outcome of Game Two was no easier to predict. In his 1996 match with IBM\'s Deep Blue supercomputer, world chess champion Gary Kasparov lost the first game but then came back to win the second game and, eventually, the match as a whole. It wasn\'t until the following year that Deep Blue topped Kasparov over the course of a six-game contest. The thing to realize is that, after playing AlphaGo for the first time on Wednesday, Lee Sedol could adjust his style of play - just as Kasparov did back in 1996. But AlphaGo could not. Because this Google creation relies so heavily on machine learning techniques, the DeepMind team needs a good four to six weeks to train a new incarnation of the system. And that means they can\'t really change things during this eight-day match.  "This is about teaching and learning," Hassabis told us just before Game Two. "One game is not enough data to learn from - for a machine - and training takes an awful lot of time.'}

The surprisingly skillful Google machine, known as AlphaGo, now needs only one more win to claim victory in the match. The Korean-born Lee Sedol will go down in defeat unless he takes each of the match\'s last three games. Though machines have beaten the best humans at chess, checkers, Othello, Scrabble, Jeopardy!, and so many other games considered tests of human intellect, they have never beaten the very best at Go. Game Three is set for Saturday afternoon inside Seoul\'s Four Seasons hotel.  The match is a way of judging the suddenly rapid progress of artificial intelligence. One of the machine-learning techniques at the heart of AlphaGo has already reinvented myriad online services inside Google and other big-name Internet companies, helping to identify images, recognize commands spoken into smartphones, improve search engine results, and more.
